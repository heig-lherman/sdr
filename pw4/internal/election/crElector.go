/*
NewCRElector constructs and returns a new Chang-Roberts elector.

Parameters
  - logger: The logger to use for logging messages.
  - self: The address of the current process.
  - dispatcher: The dispatcher to use for sending messages to processes in the network.
  - ringAddrs: A slice of addresses, the order of which represents the ring. Note that [self] *must* appear in the slice, though it may appear in any position.

Returns:
  - A new Chang-Roberts elector instance.

Note that the elector will start running in the background as soon as it is created.
